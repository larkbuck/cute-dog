## Notes:

#### YouTube tutorials
* The completed demo has a few added features I mentioned but didn't complete in the YouTube videos (ie. paw icon in navbar)
* I also changed some of the navbar text and created blank subpages for "project" as well as "bio"

#### Custom CSS classes:

* Here's the custom classes added to the demo and ready to go. There aren't any setup for the navbar - that's on you!

      /* custom css for jumbotron */
      .jumbo-custom {}

      /* class for whole portfolio grid div */
      .portfolio {
        color: #212121;
      }

      /* text in portfolio div */
      .portfolio p {
        padding-top: 15px;
      }

      /* each portfolio grid item */
      .port-item {
      }

      /* all portfolio photos */
      .port-photo {
        box-shadow: 5px 10px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
      }

      /* for footer */
      .page-footer {
      }
